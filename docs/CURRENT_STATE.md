# Current State

## Purpose

This file is the durable project state checkpoint for ArchetypeOS.

Every new engineering session should read this before planning or implementation.

## Status

- Project: ArchetypeOS
- Phase: v0.1 foundation
- Current sprint: Sprint 2 — Operating Loop and first runtime proof
- Source of truth: GitHub repository
- First runtime target: Windows 11 + WSL 2 Ubuntu
- Plane status: back online as of 2026-07-05; `ArchetypeOS` project seeded (AOS-1..AOS-9); markdown state files remain the durable fallback board

## Recently Merged

- PR #1: Runtime foundation
- PR #2: CI and deterministic PR Guardian
- PR #3: CI enforcement and branch protection documentation
- PR #5: Repository Registry MVP
- PR #6: Verification Protocol
- PR #7: Agent Communication Bus and PR Monitoring skill
- PR #8: Branch Isolation / Worktree Protocol
- PR #10: Independent Architecture Review artifact
- PR #11: Engineering OS Strategy and WSL Windows 11 Runtime Target
- PR #12: Operating Loop planning docs recovery
- PR #13: State reconciliation
- PR #14: Repository Scanner MVP (AOS-RUNTIME-002)
- PR #15: Post-merge state reconciliation for AOS-RUNTIME-002
- PR #21: Build Process Hardening (AOS-PROC-001)

## Current Objective

AOS-KNOW-001 — Knowledge Vault Seed is in progress on this branch; PR to be opened.

## Active Branch

- `claude/aos-runtime-002-scanner-1egyjw` (restarted from `main` for post-merge state reconciliation)

## CI Status

- CI exists
- PR Guardian exists
- Verification Protocol is active
- PR Monitoring skill exists
- Branch Isolation / Worktree Protocol is active
- WSL Windows 11 is the accepted first runtime target

## Verification Status

- Status: Verification pending
- Level: Level 1
- Method: repository inspection of the vault structure against `docs/KNOWLEDGE_VAULT_STRUCTURE.md`, plus local PR Guardian run on the diff; GitHub CI pending after PR creation.
- Evidence: vault tree matches the required structure; wiki pages refreshed from state docs; manifest updated.
- Limitations: content-only change, no executable surface; `KnowledgePage` API read path deferred.
- Required Next Verifier: GitHub CI / PR Guardian, then Orchestrator review

## In Scope Now

- knowledge vault seed
- state updates

## Out Of Scope Now

- local WSL/Docker verification
- Plane sync
- desktop automation
- browser automation
- wake word
- autonomous coding without approval gates
- production deployment

## Open Decisions

| Decision | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Plane integration depth | Board adopted | Sync discipline = AOS-9. |
| Agent dashboard implementation | Deferred | Engineering Control Tower design exists; implementation comes after scanner/runtime data. |
| Multi-agent live communication | Deferred | Durable artifact communication first. |
| Verification Engine implementation | Deferred | Protocol and provider abstraction first; automated provider selection later. |
| Local Level 2 verification | Blocked | Resume when Windows 11/WSL workstation access returns. |

## Blockers

- Local WSL/Docker Level 2 verification on the user's workstation: pending confirmation.

## Next Recommended Task

Merge the AOS-KNOW-001 PR after CI passes. Then pick the next package from Plane (AOS-4, AOS-5, AOS-7, AOS-8, or AOS-9).
