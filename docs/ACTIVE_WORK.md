- Required Next Verifier: None.

## Blocked Work

- Plane is temporarily down again (brief outage noted 2026-07-05 after PR #23 merged); the `ArchetypeOS` Plane project remains the live board when reachable, and these markdown files carry state meanwhile. Pending Plane update when it returns: AOS-3 → Done.
- Local WSL/Docker Level 2 verification is still listed pending workstation confirmation.

## Deferred Work

- desktop automation
- browser automation
- wake word
- full voice streaming
- autonomous coding without approval gates
- marketplace
- simulation lab
- graph database
- automated Verification Engine provider selection

## Update Rule

Every active branch or PR must update this file when work status changes, including verification status and required next verifier.

Work status changes update both Plane and this file; on conflict, this file (markdown) wins until AOS-9 defines full sync discipline.
