# Current State

## Purpose

This file is the durable project state checkpoint for ArchetypeOS.

Every new engineering session should read this before planning or implementation.

## Status

- Project: ArchetypeOS
- Phase: v0.1 COMPLETE (2026-07-05); post-v0.1 development underway
- Current sprint: Sprint 5 — Enforcement & Foundations (open, cycle `8bc59801`); Sprint 4 COMPLETE (PRs #39-#42); orchestration now Opus 4.8
- Source of truth: GitHub repository
- First runtime target: Windows 11 + WSL 2 Ubuntu
- Plane status: back online and fully synced; `ArchetypeOS` project live (AOS-1..AOS-9, 10 modules, Sprint 2 cycle); markdown state files remain the durable fallback board and win on conflict

## Current Objective

Sprint 5 package 5: AOS-SCHED-001 (RFC-0007 backend seed / RFC-0006 Phase 3a, Plane AOS-18) in review on this branch — schedules-as-data (`Schedule` model + Alembic migration `0002`, the first real migration) + a single-instance control-plane `apps/scheduler` service that turns due schedules into queued jobs via one shared `enqueue_job` path; Schedule CRUD API. Folds in the PR #46 reconciliation. The dashboard (AOS-SCHED-002) closes AOS-18.

## Active Branch

- `claude/aos-runtime-002-scanner-1egyjw` (restarted from `main` for post-merge state reconciliation)

## CI Status

- CI exists
- PR Guardian exists
- Verification Protocol is active
- PR Monitoring skill exists
- Branch Isolation / Worktree Protocol is active
- WSL Windows 11 is the accepted first runtime target

## Verification Status

- Status: Verification pending
- Level: Level 4
- Method: Orchestrator independently verified on a Python 3.12 venv — Alembic migration `0002` upgrade → 22 tables incl. `schedules`, no-drift autogenerate probe = 0 ops (the first real migration matches the model exactly); api suite **75 passed** (69 + 6 new: schedule CRUD, run-now, `run_due_schedules` tick enqueues due + skips not-due/disabled); worker 5 unchanged; ruff clean incl. `apps/scheduler`. CI compose-smoke (migration `0002` on fresh Postgres + the new scheduler container builds/boots — added to the build/up lists, LES-011) pending after PR creation
- Evidence: no-drift 0 ops after `0002`; 75 api tests; scheduler service + compose block; one enqueue path (`aos_core.services.jobs`)
- Limitations: interval cadence only (no cron); single-instance scheduler (HA deferred per RFC-0007); dashboard is AOS-SCHED-002
- Required Next Verifier: GitHub CI (compose-smoke) / PR Guardian, then Orchestrator review

## In Scope Now

- Sprint 5 package 5: scheduler seed — schedules-as-data + control-plane scheduler (AOS-SCHED-001, RFC-0007)

## Out Of Scope Now

- Plane two-way sync automation (AOS-9, not started)
- desktop automation
- browser automation
- wake word
- autonomous coding without approval gates
- production deployment

## Open Decisions

| Decision | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Plane integration depth | Board adopted with documented sync discipline | See `docs/PLANE_PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.md`; automation deferred. |
| Agent dashboard implementation | First surface shipped | AOS-CTRL-001 merged (PR #27); richer views come after scan history (AOS-4). |
| Multi-agent live communication | Deferred | Durable artifact communication first. |
| Verification Engine implementation | Deferred | Protocol and provider abstraction first; automated provider selection later. |
| Local Level 2 verification | Done | AOS-LOCAL-001 executed on `teevee-1` 2026-07-05; runtime Verified at Level 4 on the declared target. |

## Blockers

- None. Plane is back online and synced; workstation `teevee-1` confirmed available via Tailscale.

## Next Recommended Task

Merge the AOS-SCHED-001 PR after CI passes under the Manual Merge Gate. Then AOS-SCHED-002 (scheduler dashboard: schedules UI + enqueue buttons + job history) closes AOS-18 and the worker pipeline. AOS-21 (second repo) can run in parallel. Council (AOS-19, RFC-0005) after the worker/scheduler foundations land.
